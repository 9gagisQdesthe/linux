We will cover some basic steps such as oil lubrication, installing the needle, threading the machine, adjusting the tension, and sewing a sample. We will also provide some tips and precautions to ensure your safety and the performance of the machine.
  
## Oil Lubrication
 
Before you start using the Siruba L818F M1 industrial sewing machine, you need to lubricate it with oil. Oil lubrication is essential for reducing friction and wear between the moving parts of the machine. It also helps to prevent rust and corrosion. You should lubricate the machine every day before starting work or after eight hours of continuous use.
 
To lubricate the machine, follow these steps:
 
1. Turn off the power switch and unplug the machine from the power source.
2. Remove the oil pan cover and check the oil level. The oil level should be between the upper and lower marks on the oil gauge. If the oil level is low, add oil until it reaches the upper mark. Do not overfill or underfill the oil pan. Use only high-quality sewing machine oil that meets the specifications of Siruba.
3. Replace the oil pan cover and wipe off any excess oil from the surface of the machine.
4. Plug in the machine and turn on the power switch. Run the machine at a low speed for a few minutes to distribute the oil throughout the machine.
5. Turn off the power switch and unplug the machine again. Check for any oil leaks or spills. If you find any, fix them immediately or contact Siruba customer service for assistance.

## Installing the Needle
 
The needle is one of the most important parts of the sewing machine. It determines the quality and appearance of your stitches. You should always use a new and sharp needle that matches your fabric type and thread size. You should also replace your needle regularly or whenever it becomes bent, blunt, or damaged.
 
To install or replace the needle on your Siruba L818F M1 industrial sewing machine, follow these steps:

1. Turn off the power switch and unplug the machine from the power source.
2. Raise the needle bar to its highest position by turning the handwheel toward you.
3. Loosen the needle clamp screw with a screwdriver and remove the old needle from the needle bar.
4. Insert a new needle into the needle bar with its flat side facing backward and its groove facing forward. Make sure that it is fully inserted up to its shoulder.
5. Tighten the needle clamp screw securely with a screwdriver.
